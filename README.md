# What is this APP?

This application is a Task List App that allows you to write down your daily chores by making an http API request and using the GET, POST and DELETE methods. 

A JSON mock server was used in order to generate the database.

# Coding language used

This project was coded with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 12.2.9. 

Don't forget to install the modules using the following command:

`npm install`

# Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

# Mock Server ( database / backend )

Install the JSON-server globally using the following npm command:

`npm install -g json-server`

Start the server:

`json-server --watch db.json`
